# Petitjean-Index
This repository contains a jupyter notebook where a python script is used to calculate the PetitJean index of a set of molecules. The petitjean index a popular topological descriptor, which is a type of shape descriptor that is calculated from the connection matrix/table of a molecular structure.\ 
In other words this well-commented program takes as an input a directory, containing multiple molecule structures in molfile format (1st part). It can also work for sdf files that encode multiiple chemical structures (2nd part). The program output will be the name of the molecule, the value of its PetitJean Index, as well as a graphical representation of the molecule.
